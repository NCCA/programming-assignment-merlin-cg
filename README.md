# Tom Bates CFGAA Assignment

## Ideas

I have not finalised an idea for the assignment, but here are some of my ideas:


1. WebGPU terrain erosion
2. OpenGL Physics engine


## OpenGL terrain erosion

Applied vertical perlin noise (fractal) on my vertex array. Next step is to create an EBO from indicies to generate triangles.
